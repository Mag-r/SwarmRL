SwarmRL
-------
Python package to study colloid motion with reinforcement learning.

Installation
============

Currently SwamrRL is only available from source so it must be installed within the local
directory.

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/christophlohrmann/SwarmRL.git
   cd SwarmRL
   pip install -e .

This will install the package with a reference to the current directory.
This means that if you change the code, you will not need to re-install it.
